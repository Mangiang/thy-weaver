## Why?

For some time now, I have been using [SugarCube Starter by nijikokun](https://github.com/nijikokun/sugarcube-starter), he did a amazing job, but coming from using Vite, the slowness of Webpack really started to bother me

Then, as a bit of a challenge to myself, I wanted to remake it without Webpack

You can consider this a "spiritual successor" (Event though, as far as I know, Nijikokun still is working on SG Starter), and it's mostly based on it

## Features

- Quickly scaffold a new project, (Thanks to [create-weaver](/packages/create-weaver/readme.md))
- Automatic Tweego setup (Thanks to [Tweenode](https://github.com/greatsquare0/tweenode))
- Includes updated story formats, like:
  - SugarCube v2.37.3
  - Harlowe v3.3.9 
  - Chapbook v2.2.0
- Highly customizable, easy to configure
- *Lighting fast* automatic builds
- Local live reload server
- Directory for third-party scripts
- Modern workflow

## How to use

Check out the docs, [available here](https://greatsquare0.github.io/thy-weaver/)

## Planned features

- [ ] Add support for packaging `dist` directory.
- [ ] Add support for compiling to Electron or Tauri application.
